# Web Application: Practice Keybinds for WoW Arena
* I explain the app on reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldofpvp/comments/104zpds/there_are_just_not_enough_players_wanting_to_play/
* Link to try: https://reaction-helper.web.app/

# Do-to:
* Let the user keybind their own keys for each of the options. This would allow interactive training sessions, where the website would keep track of correct and incorrect presses.
